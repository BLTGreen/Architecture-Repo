# Internal Principles

I usually break architectural principles down under the following guidelines, delineating them under any departmental or enterprise goals:

* Maintainability
* Scalability
* Performance
* Usability
* Security

As I've been given some specific principles to cover, I'll work on ensuring I've got full coverage.

## Secure by Design Principles
The UK Government has a set of principles to ensure architects keep security top of mind. Here's the high level items:

1. Create responsibility for Cybersecurity Risk
2. Source secure technology products
3. Adopt a risk-driven approach
4. Design usable security controls
5. Build in 'detect and respond' security
6. Design flexible architecture
7. Minimise the attack surface
8. Defend in depth
9. Embed continuous assurance
10. Make changes securely


## Well Architected Principles (Azure / AWS)
Azure and AWS have a lot of overlap in their principles, making them natural partners. Here's what I'll be keeping in mind:


## NFRs

Performance, scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.
Data availability, consistency, and audit-ability.
Cost considerations for AWS-Azure data transfer

# Bringing all of these together

Because these frameworks are pretty harmonious in bringing together a best practises view, we can define what our design principles are, based on all of the above.

### Measurability

Following the above guidelines:
- Secure by Design Principle 9: Embed Continuous Assurance
- 

### Scalability

Scalability is how we respond to a changing landscape. It concerns manual change management, and flexibility. 

### Security

### Cost

### Availability

### Consistency

### Auditability



# How I plan to work from these

I'll be using this table to break down any approach trade-offs to ensure I'm covering the necessary NFRs/principles in my comparisons.

| Approach | Measurability | Scalability | Security | Cost | Speed to Dev | Availability | Consistency | Auditability |  Final Score |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
|          |         |         |          |         |         |          |         |         |         |
|          |         |         |          |         |         |          |         |         |         |
|          |         |         |          |         |         |          |         |         |         |
