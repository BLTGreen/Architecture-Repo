# Tailored ADM for Data Sharing Architecture

In TOGAF we can tailor the ADM to create a lighter weight framework that fits the project being worked on. Here's my proposal for a tailored ADM for this project:

## Preliminary Phase

**The objectives of the Preliminary Phase are to:**

* Determine the Architecture Capability desired by the organization:
  * Identify and scope the elements affected by the architecture request
  * Identify the established frameworks, methods, and processes that intersect with the Architecture Capability
  * Establish target
* Establish the Architecture Capability:
  * Define and establish the detailed process and resources for Architecture Governance
  * Select and implement tools that support the Architecture Capability
* Define the Architecture Principles
* Develop a strategy and implementation plan for tools and techniques

## Phase A: Architectural Vision

**The objectives of Phase A are to:**

* Develop a high-level aspirational **vision** of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed Enterprise Architecture
* Identify stakeholders, concerns, and business requirements
* Define scope
* Obtain approval for a program of works to develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision

## Phase B: Business Architecture

**The objectives of Phase B are to:**

* Develop the Target Business Architecture that describes how the enterprise needs to operate to achieve the business goals, and respond to the strategic drivers set out in the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses any stakeholder concerns
* Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Business Architectures
* Select reference models, viewpoints, and tools
* Develop Target Business Architecture Description
* Conduct formal stakeholder review (have stakeholders review the business architecture)
* Create/Update the Architecture Definition Document

## Phase C: Information Systems and Data Architecture

**The objectives of Phase C are to:**

* Develop the Target Data Architecture that enables the requirements and the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses any stakeholder concerns
* Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Data Architectures
* Select reference models, viewpoints, and tools
* Develop Target Data Architecture Description
* Conduct formal stakeholder review (have stakeholders review the data architecture)
* Create/Update the Architecture Definition Document

## Phase D: Application Architecture

**The objectives of Phase D are to:**

* Develop the Target Application Architecture that enables the requirements and the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses any stakeholder concerns
* Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Application Architectures
* Select reference models, viewpoints, and tools
* Develop Target Application Architecture Description
* Conduct formal stakeholder review (have stakeholders review the application architecture)
* Create/Update the Architecture Definition Document

## Phase E: Technology Architecture

**The objectives of Phase E are to:**

* Develop the Target Technology Architecture that enables the requirements and the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses any stakeholder concerns
* Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Technology Architectures
* Select reference models, viewpoints, and tools
* Develop Target Technology Architecture Description
* Conduct formal stakeholder review (have stakeholders review the technology architecture)
* Create/Update the Architecture Definition Document

## Phase F: Opportunities and Solutions

**The objectives of Phase F are to:**

* Generate the initial complete version of the Architecture Roadmap, based upon the gap analysis and candidate Architecture Roadmap components from Phases B, C, D, and E
* Determine whether an incremental approach is required, and if so identify Transition Architectures that will deliver continuous business value
* Define the overall Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) to finalize the Target Architecture based on the ABBs

## Phase G: Migration and Implementation Planning

**The objectives of Phase G are to:**

* Finalize the Architecture Roadmap and the supporting Implementation and Migration Plan
* Confirm Architecture Roadmap and update Architecture Definition Document
* Ensure that the Implementation and Migration Plan is co-ordinated with the enterprise's approach to managing and implementing change in the enterprise's overall change portfolio
* Ensure that the business value and cost of work packages and Transition Architectures is understood by key stakeholders
* Prioritize any migration projects through the conduct of a cost/benefit assessment and risk validation


## Phase H: Governance and Compliance

**The objectives of Phase G are to:**

* Ensure conformance with the Target Architecture 
* Perform Enterprise Architecture Compliance reviews
* Perform post-implementation review and close the implementation
* Complete the architecture development cycle and document lessons learned

## Post-Delivery: Change Management

**The objectives of Change Management are to:**

* Ensure that the architecture development cycle is maintained
* Establish value realization process
* Deploy monitoring tools 
* Manage risks 
* Provide analysis for architecture change management 
* Develop change requirements to meet performance targets
* Ensure that the Architecture Governance Framework is executed
* Ensure that the Enterprise Architecture Capability meets current requirements
* Activate the process to implement change if necessary
