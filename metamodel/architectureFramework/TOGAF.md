# TOGAF

For this project I'd suggest utilising the TOGAF standard. The latest standard (v10) is available here: https://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/

## Why TOGAF?

TOGAF is incredibly granular with a focus on delivery, business requirements, data, and security. 

Utilising their BDAT approach (Business Architecture, Data Architecture, Application Architecture, Technology Architecture) and their change management, we can cover this project from inception to delivery...and past delivery, into change management.

Furthermore, TOGAF's focus on architect as holistic part of the team, encouraging an approach where architecture collaborates with all levels of the enterprise, sets up a really good system for delivering a product that will be used by internal facing teams and external facing teams.

It sets us up to ensure that whatever we build is the **best thing we can build** for all stakeholders, internal or external.

## Why TOGAF over Zachmann or other frameworks?

I'd argue for TOGAF in a hybrid cloud environment. The flexibility of TOGAF and the comprehensive processes involved in each step work to allow us to set our standards but ensure those standards are absolutely rigorous as we design and deliver.

TOGAF allows us to create architecture, process and alignment. Zachman is useful for organising and understanding that architecture once it's in place.
