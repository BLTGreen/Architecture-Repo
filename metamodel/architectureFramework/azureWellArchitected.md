# Azure Well Architected

Normally I embed PDFs of frameworks into my repositories, but the Azure Well Architected Framework is even longer than the AWS version, with over 1200 pages.

To save on bandwidth, I traditionally instead place a link [https://learn.microsoft.com/pdf?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Fwell-architected%2Ftoc.json](here).
