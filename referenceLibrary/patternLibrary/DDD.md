# Domain Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design is a framework that requires that we model software based on specific domains; rather than having a single, bounded model, it asks that we use bounded contexts, each of which have their own model.

Rather than a monolith, instead we have domains.

Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

- placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic layer;
- basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
- initiating a creative collaboration between technical and subject matter experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
