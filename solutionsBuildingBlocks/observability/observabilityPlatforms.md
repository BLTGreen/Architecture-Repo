# Tracking metrics cross-cloud

## Grafana

We can set up a Grafana platform to act as a dashboard and visualisation for our metrics. 

## Azure Sentinel

We can use Open ID Connect to allow Azure Sentinel access to the logging produced by CloudWatch and CloudTrail.

Sentinel can then ingest these logs and analyse them, alerting us to any issues.
