# Suggested User Roles

Here's the roles I'd consider at minimum. I'll identify their permissions in the user access matrix. [/solutionsBuildingBlocks\modelsAndDiagrams\business\userAccessMatrix.md](here)

* **Security Lead**
* **Security Architect** 
* **Platform Engineer**
* **Data Engineer**
* **DevOps**
* **Risk and Compliance User**
* **Application Security Engineer**
* **Data Analyst**
* **User** 

 Azure has over 100 built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services. This gives us a headstart in developing user access management.
