# Key Management

## Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault is a service provided by Microsoft Azure to safeguard cryptographic keys, secrets 
(such as passwords, database connection strings, etc.), and certificates used by cloud applications 
and services. It acts as a secure repository where organizations can store these confidential items, 
mitigating the risk of inadvertent or malicious exposure.

## AWS KMS

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an AWS managed service that makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys that are used to encrypt data. The AWS KMS keys that are created in AWS KMS are protected by FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 validated hardware security modules (HSM). 

# Summary

Both Key Vault and KMS provide granular access policies for keys, secrets, and certificates 
separately.
